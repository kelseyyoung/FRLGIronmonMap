## https://kelseyyoung.github.io/FRLGIronmonMap

This is an interactive map of Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen meant for Ironmon challenge runners. For information on what Ironmon is, [join the discord](https://discord.gg/QEEsmNUX)

## Using the map

Trainer information is available on hover, showing the number of pokemon they have, the levels of their pokemon, and any movement information. Trainers can be "marked" by clicking on them

Items are also clickable/markable, and hidden items with step spawn rates have that information shown on hover

Map "portals", like cave entrances and ladders, are clickable too! They will move the map to where it connects
