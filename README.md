# Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen Ironmon Map

https://kelseyyoung.github.io/FRLGIronmonMap

This is an interactive map of Pokemon FireRed/LeafGreen meant for Ironmon challenge runners. For information on what Ironmon is, [join the discord](https://discord.gg/QEEsmNUX)

## Using the map

Clicking and dragging moves the map, right click also works. Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel

Hovering over a trainer shows information about them, clicking on a trainer cycles through different "marks". Items can also be marked, if hidden items have a certain spawn rate that information is also available on hover
